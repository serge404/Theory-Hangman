Hangman game: description
-------------------------
Our Hangman game is designed so a user gets to guess a word from a dictionary full of words and hints. A user must guess the whole word correctly by guessing letters; If the user exceeds more than 7 failed attempts at trying to guess the character in the word, the player loses. Otherwise if the player guesses all the letters in the word correctly before the max amount of errors is reached than the user wins.

The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word.
If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions.
If the suggested letter or number does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark. User can make up to seven mistakes before hangman diagram is complete.
